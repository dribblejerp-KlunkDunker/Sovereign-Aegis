/**
 * SOVEREIGN // AEGIS — one way to record an attempt
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM attemptlog.js
 * --------------------------------------------
 * `js/attemptlog.js` is storage: one record in, one record out. But eight modules have a
 * right/wrong moment, and each of them needs the same four decisions made the same way:
 *
 *   1. one record per tested SKILL, not per screen — the estimator filters by skillId, so an
 *      item that tests two skills is evidence about both;
 *   2. never awaited — append() resolves after the IndexedDB transaction commits, and a
 *      dropped attempt costs one sample where a stalled quiz costs the session;
 *   3. an untagged item warns once and is dropped, rather than being written under a guessed
 *      skill — a wrong data point is worse than a missing one;
 *   4. `heldOut` is carried from the content, never decided at the call site.
 *
 * If each module made those decisions for itself, they would drift, and the drift would show
 * up as quietly wrong mastery numbers months later. So they are made once, here.
 *
 * This module deliberately has no opinion about *what* counts as correct. That judgement
 * belongs to the module that owns the interaction — a self-graded recall, a multiple-choice
 * answer and a branching decision are not the same kind of evidence, and pretending
 * otherwise here would hide the difference.
 *
 * @module attempts
